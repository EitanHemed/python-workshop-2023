## Contents

This repository includes the materials used in a two-day workshop taught for graduate students at the University of Haifa (July 2023). Participants are 
expected to have some understanding of data and statistical analysis, but the workshop does not assume any prior knowledge of Python or programming in general.


Largely the workshop consists of two modules:
1. Fundementals of Python programming (Data types, control flow, functions, etc.)
2. Common data analysis tasks using Python (Data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, etc.)



## Files
Files in the following directories are used in the workshop:
* notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used in the workshop (with/without exercise solutions).
* sample_data/: Data files used in the workshop for participants using other platforms than Google Colab.


## Installation

Assuming you have conda installed, you can create a new environment with all the required packages using the provided environment.yml file.

* To install the required packages, run the following commands in the terminal:
```conda env create -f environment.yml```
* To activate the environment, run the following command in the terminal:
```conda activate python-workshop-2023```
* Use `jupyter notebook` to run notebooks as required.
